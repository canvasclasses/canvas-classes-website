Proline is a six membered cyclic ring amino acid** ✗\n- Proline has a **5-membered** pyrrolidine ring\n\n**D. Glycine does not have chiral centre** ✓\n- Glycine: $H_2N-CH_2-COOH$\n- The α-carbon has 2 H atoms (not chiral)\n\n**E. Cysteine side chain is $CH_3S-CH_2-CH_2-$** ✗\n- Cysteine: $HS-CH_2-$ (thiol, not thioether)\n- The given structure is for **Methionine**\n\n**Correct: A and D**\n\n![Option1](/questions/jee_2026_jan21m_q67_solution.webp)"
