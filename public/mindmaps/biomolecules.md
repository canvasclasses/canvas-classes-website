# Biomolecules

## Carbohydrates
- Classification by Hydrolysis
    - Monosaccharides (Glucose, Fructose)
    - Oligosaccharides (Sucrose, Lactose, Maltose)
    - Polysaccharides (Starch, Cellulose, Glycogen)
- Chemical Nature
    - Optically active polyhydroxy aldehydes/ketones
    - Reducing sugars have hemiacetal group like Glucose, Fructose, lactose, maltose
- Glycosidic linkage
    - Maltose/Starch: Glucose + Glucose (&#x3b1;-1,4 linkage)
    - Sucrose: Glucose + Fructose (&#x3b1;-1,2 linkage)
    - Glycosidic linkage
- Importance
    - Energy source (Glucose, Honey)
    - Storage (Starch, Glycogen)

## Proteins
- Building Blocks
    - Macromolecules made of Alpha-Amino Acids
    - vital for structure, enzymes, transport, and defense
    - Peptide linkage connects two amino acids
    - Zwitter ion (Amphoteric behavior
    - isoelectric point is the pH when molecule has zero net electrical charge
- Structure Levels
    - Primary (The specific sequence of amino acids in a polypeptide chain)
    - Secondary (Local folding into patterns like alpha-helices and beta-sheets, stabilized by hydrogen bonds)
    - Tertiary (Overall folding formed by ionic, disulfide bridges interactions
    - Quaternary (Subunit arrangement) like hemoglobin
- Classification
    - Fibrous (Keratin, Myosin)
    - Globular (Insulin, Albumin)
- Denaturation (Loss of activity via heat/pH)

## Enzymes
- Biocatalysts (Globular proteins)
- Highly specific and selective
- Reduce activation energy

## Vitamins
- Fat Soluble
    - Vitamins A, D, E, K
- Water Soluble
    - B group and Vitamin C
- Deficiency Diseases (Scurvy, Beri beri, Rickets)

## Nucleic Acids
- Components
    - Pentose Sugar (Ribose/Deoxyribose)
    - Phosphoric Acid
    - Nitrogenous Bases (A, G, C, T, U)
- Types
    - DNA (Double helix, heredity carrier)
        - stores long-term genetic blueprints
        - uses deoxyribose sugar, and has bases A, T, C, G
        - Very stable, good for information storage
    - RNA (Single stranded, Translates DNA code into proteins, carries out cellular functions)
        - carries out protein instructions
        - uses ribose sugar, and has bases A, U, C, G
        - functions like protein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA)
        - More reactive and less stable, designed for short-term use
- DNA Fingerprinting (Unique base sequences)
