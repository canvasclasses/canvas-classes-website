144. (a) Given:

Pressure of \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) gas evolved \(=715-15=\) 700 mmHg
In atmospheres: 700/760 atm
Using the Ideal Gas Law:
Moles of \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) evolved = PV / RT
Substitute the values:
\(\frac{700 \times 60 \times 10^{-3}}{760 \times 0.0821 \times 300}=0.0022\) moles
Weight. of \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) evolved \(=0.0022 \times 28 =0.063\) grams
Percentage of Nitrogen in the Compound
\(=\frac{\text { wt. of nitrogen }}{\text { wt. of compound }} \times 100\)
Substituting the values:
\(=(0.063 / 0.4) \times 100=15.71 \%\)
145. [20] For \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\), partial pressure \(=(900-15) =885 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\)

Therefore, percentage of nitrogen in organic compound
\[

Using ideal Gas Law to find moles of \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) :
\(\mathrm{n}=\frac{\mathrm{PV}}{\mathrm{RT}}=\frac{\left(\frac{700}{760}\right) \times 0.050}{0.0821 \times 300}=0.00187 \mathrm{~mol}\)
Mass of nitrogen \(\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)=0.00187 \mathrm{~mol} \times 28 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{mol}=0.02618 \mathrm{~g}\).

Moles of \(\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}=\frac{466 \times 10^{-3}}{233}\)
\(=2 \times 10^{-3}\) moles
Since, 1 mole of \(\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}\) contains 1 mole of sulphur, therefore, \(2 \times 10^{-3}\) moles of \(\mathrm{BaSO}_{4}\) will contain \(2 \times 10^{-3}\) moles of sulphur.

As compared to ortho product, para product has higher boiling point. Intermolecular H -bonding takes place in para, while in ortho, intramolecular H -bonding takes place. Steam distillation can separate the two products as -ortho product is steam volatile.
173. (c) The spots of colourless compounds, that are invisible to eyes can be found by putting the plate under UV light in thin layer chromatography.

Another is to place the plate in a covered jar containing \(\mathrm{I}_{2}(\mathrm{~s})\) and sometimes an appropriate reagent can also be sprayed on the plate, like ninhydrin in cases of amino acids.
174. (d) Both benzoic acid \& naphthalene are soluble in benzene and they can be separated out by crystallization. Benzoic acid is soluble in hot water while naphthalene is insoluble.
175. (a) Both the given statements are correct.

177. (b) To remove NaCN and \(\mathrm{Na}_{2} \mathrm{~S}\), sodium fusion extract is boiled with conc. \(\mathrm{HNO}_{3}\). This is Lassaigne's test.
178. (a) \(\therefore\) Moles of \(\mathrm{AgBr}=\frac{\text { Mass }}{\text { molar mass }} =\frac{0.36}{188}\)
∴ Mass of Bromine \(=\frac{0.36}{188} \times 80=0.1532 \mathrm{gm}\)
\(\therefore \% \mathrm{Br}\) in compound \(=\)
\(\frac{0.1532}{0.45} \times 100=34.04 \%\)
179. (b) The formation of Brown ring takes place due to nitrosoferrous sulphate complex.

Calculate weight of Br as:
Weight of Br in \(\mathrm{AgBr}=\left(\frac{80}{188} \times 0.2397\right)=\) 0.102 g

Now,
\(\% \mathrm{Br}\) in compound \(=\frac{0.102 \times 100}{0.15}=68 \%\)
198. [40] Mass of organic compound \(=0.2 \mathbf{g} \mathrm{n}_{\mathrm{AgBr}}=\frac{\text { Weight of } \mathrm{AgBr}}{\text { Molar mass of } \mathrm{AgBr}}=\frac{0.188}{188} \mathrm{~mol} =0.001 \mathrm{~mol}\)

Mass of \(\mathrm{Br}=\) moles of \(\mathrm{Br} \times\) Molar mass of Br

According to reaction, we have

0.5 mol of \(\mathrm{C}_{7} \mathrm{H}_{17} \mathrm{~N} \rightarrow \frac{45}{2} \times 0.5 \mathrm{~mol}\) of CuO \(\Rightarrow \mathrm{n}_{\text {CuO }}=\left(\frac{45}{2}\right) \times 0.5 \mathrm{~mol}=11.25 \mathrm{~mol}\)

\(42=\frac{1.4 \times(1 \times 2) \times \text { volume of acid used }}{0.8}\)
Now, volume of acid used \(=\frac{42 \times 0.8}{1.4 \times 2} \mathrm{~mL}\)

\(=1.25 \times 10^{-3}\)
\(\left(\because \mathrm{R}=0.0821 \mathrm{~L} \mathrm{~atm} \mathrm{k}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}\right)\)
Weight of \(\mathrm{N}_{2}\) gas \(=1.25 \times 10^{-3} \times 28 =0.035 \mathrm{~g}\)
