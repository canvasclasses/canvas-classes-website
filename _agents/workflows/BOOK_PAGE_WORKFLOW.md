# Book Page Builder — Canonical Workflow

> Single source of truth for building digital book pages in the NCERT Simplified platform.
> **When building any book page, follow this document exactly.**

---

## 1. What You Are Building

A **BookPage** is a focused, self-contained lesson page inside a digital textbook.  
Each page = one section of NCERT content, transformed from dry textbook prose into an engaging, JEE/NEET-ready learning unit.

**Target reader:** Class 11–12 student preparing for JEE/NEET. Smart, busy, and slightly intimidated. They need clarity first, then depth.

---

## 2. API — How to Create a Page

```
POST http://localhost:3000/api/v2/books/ncert-simplified/pages
Content-Type: application/json
```

Required body fields:
```json
{
  "title": "Page Title",
  "subtitle": "One-line hook — what they'll understand after reading",
  "slug": "url-safe-lowercase-with-hyphens",
  "chapter_number": 1,
  "page_number": N,
  "blocks": [ ...block array... ],
  "tags": []
}
```

**`page_number`** must be the correct position for the new page. Always query existing pages first:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v2/books/ncert-simplified/pages
```

### Inserting a page mid-sequence (CRITICAL — follow exactly)

If the new page goes between existing pages, you MUST shift the existing pages first using the
reorder endpoint before creating the new page. **Never use PUT with only metadata to shift pages —
it wipes blocks.** Use PATCH /reorder instead:

```bash
# Step 1 — shift affected pages up (highest page_number first to avoid conflicts)
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/v2/books/ncert-simplified/pages/reorder \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "updates": [
      {"slug": "last-page-slug",   "page_number": 5},
      {"slug": "middle-page-slug", "page_number": 4},
      {"slug": "target-slug",      "page_number": 3}
    ]
  }'

# Step 2 — create the new page at the now-free position
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v2/books/ncert-simplified/pages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{ "page_number": 2, ... }'
```

The reorder endpoint updates ONLY `page_number` and `chapter_number` — blocks and all content
are completely untouched. It is safe to use for page reordering and chapter reassignment.

**`slug`** rules: lowercase, alphanumeric, hyphens only. No underscores. No spaces. E.g. `chromatography`, `qualitative-analysis`, `quantitative-nitrogen`.

## 3. Block Reference — All Types

Every block has `id` (UUID v4), `type`, `order` (0-indexed).

### 3.1 `text`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "text",
  "order": 0,
  "markdown": "Markdown content with **bold**, *italic*, lists, inline $LaTeX$."
}
```
- Markdown headings (`##`, `###`) are valid inside text blocks
- Use `**bold**` for key terms on first introduction
- Use numbered lists for processes, bullet lists for properties

### 3.2 `heading`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "heading",
  "order": 1,
  "text": "Section Title",
  "level": 2
}
```
- `level: 2` for main sub-sections (renders as h3)
- `level: 3` for sub-sub-sections (renders as h4)
- Never use level 1 — page title already uses it

### 3.3 `callout`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "callout",
  "order": 2,
  "variant": "exam_tip",
  "title": "JEE / NEET Exam Insight",
  "markdown": "Bullet-point facts relevant to competitive exams."
}
```

Variants and when to use them:
| Variant | Purpose | Placement |
|---|---|---|
| `fun_fact` | Real-life hook to open the page | Block 0 (first block) |
| `exam_tip` | JEE/NEET facts, tricky distinctions, what exams actually ask | Near end, before quiz |
| `remember` | Critical definitions or rules the student must not get wrong | After relevant explanation |
| `note` | Additional context, not examinable | Optional |
| `warning` | Common mistakes / misconceptions | Optional |

**`exam_tip` format:**
```
**Key term or question:** Explanation.

**Another key term:** Explanation.

**Classic exam question:** "..." → Answer.
```

### 3.4 `image`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "image",
  "order": 3,
  "src": "",
  "alt": "Descriptive alt text for accessibility",
  "caption": "📸 Caption text describing the diagram",
  "width": "full",
  "generation_prompt": "Detailed AI image generation prompt — see Section 3.4.1 below"
}
```
- Always `width: "full"` unless explicitly told otherwise
- **`src` should be empty string `""`** when the image has not been uploaded yet
- **Always include `generation_prompt`** — this is what the user will copy into an AI image generator
- Caption always starts with `📸 `
- The renderer shows the generation prompt as a copyable placeholder when `src` is empty
- When `src` is filled with an R2 URL later, the image renders normally

### 3.4.1 Writing a good `generation_prompt`

A generation prompt should be **specific, visual, and technical**. It tells an AI image generator exactly what to draw.

Structure: `[Name] + [Spatial layout of components] + [Process arrows] + [Label list] + [Inset if useful] + [Style]`

**Template:**
```
[Technique name] apparatus diagram. [Describe each component spatially — name it, 
describe its position, and any visible internal detail]. Show arrows indicating 
[what moves where — vapour/liquid/current/flow]. Label: [Component1], [Component2], 
[Component3], [Observable result]. [Inset diagram showing [variations or related 
forms] — optional, use only when notable variants exist]. Dark background, orange 
accent labels, clean technical illustration style.
```

**Rules for each clause:**

- **Opening line:** `[Technique] apparatus diagram.` — never use "Scientific diagram of"
- **Spatial layout:** Name every component, describe its position relative to others, and call out internal detail (e.g. "beads visible", "packed with silica gel")
- **Process arrows:** Always include for dynamic processes (distillation, chromatography, extraction). Write exactly what moves and in which direction. Omit only for purely static diagrams (crystal structure, molecular model).
- **Label list:** `Label: X, Y, Z.` — list the 3–5 most important labelled parts by name
- **Inset diagram:** Add `Inset diagram showing [X, Y, Z].` when there are meaningful variants worth showing (e.g. column types, solvent systems). Skip if there are no notable variants.
- **Style:** Always end with `Dark background, orange accent labels, clean technical illustration style.` — this matches the Canvas reader theme exactly. Never use "educational poster style" or "white labels".

**Good example** (fractional distillation):
> "Fractional distillation apparatus diagram. A round-bottom flask on a heat source, with a tall fractionating column (packed column with beads visible) fitted above it, connected at the top to a condenser leading to a collection flask. Show arrows indicating vapour rising up the column and liquid falling back down. Label: Round-bottom flask, Fractionating column, Condenser, Distillate. Inset diagram showing different types of fractionating columns (Vigreux, packed, spiral). Dark background, orange accent labels, clean technical illustration style."

**Every page must have at least one image block with a generation_prompt.** Use your chemistry knowledge to decide the best visual for each concept:
- Purification techniques → apparatus setup diagram with process arrows
- Qualitative tests → test tube colour change sequence, label each tube with reagent and observation
- Quantitative estimation → multi-stage apparatus diagram with labelled collection vessels
- Formulas/calculations → do NOT generate images for these; use `latex_block` instead

### 3.5 `worked_example`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "worked_example",
  "order": 4,
  "label": "Problem 12.20",
  "variant": "ncert_intext",
  "problem": "Markdown statement of the problem with $LaTeX$ as needed.",
  "solution": "Step-by-step solution in markdown.\n\n**Step 1:** ...\n\n**Step 2:** ...\n\n**Answer:** ...",
  "reveal_mode": "tap_to_reveal"
}
```
- `variant`: `"ncert_intext"` for NCERT in-text problems; `"solved_example"` for other worked examples
- `reveal_mode`: always `"tap_to_reveal"` so students attempt before seeing answer
- `problem` and `solution` support full markdown + LaTeX
- Format solution as clear numbered/bold steps, ending with boxed answer

### 3.6 `inline_quiz`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "inline_quiz",
  "order": 5,
  "pass_threshold": 0.67,
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "question": "Question text?",
      "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
      "correct_index": 2,
      "explanation": "Why C is correct, and why the others are wrong."
    }
  ]
}
```
- Always **last block** on the page
- Minimum 2 questions, maximum 5 questions
- `pass_threshold`: 1.0 for 1 question; 0.67 for 2–3 questions; 0.6 for 4–5 questions
- `correct_index` is 0-based
- Explanation must be educational — explain the concept, not just "C is correct because C"
- Options: always exactly 4, make distractors plausible
- Questions should test understanding, not just memorisation

### 3.7 `simulation`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "simulation",
  "order": 6,
  "simulation_id": "fractional-distillation",
  "title": "Descriptive title"
}
```
- Only use if a simulation component exists at `components/books/renderer/blocks/simulations/`
- `simulation_id` must match an existing component registered in `SimulationBlockRenderer.tsx`

### 3.8 `table`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "table",
  "order": 7,
  "caption": "Table title",
  "headers": ["Column 1", "Column 2", "Column 3"],
  "rows": [
    ["Row 1 Col 1", "Row 1 Col 2", "Row 1 Col 3"],
    ["Row 2 Col 1", "Row 2 Col 2", "Row 2 Col 3"]
  ]
}
```
- Use for comparison data — reaction products, test results, properties side by side
- Keep tables narrow (2–4 columns)

### 3.9 `comparison_card`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "comparison_card",
  "order": 8,
  "title": "X vs Y",
  "columns": [
    { "heading": "Method A", "points": ["Point 1", "Point 2"] },
    { "heading": "Method B", "points": ["Point 1", "Point 2"] }
  ]
}
```
- Use when comparing two methods/techniques — exams love "distinguish between" questions
- Max 3 columns; 3–6 points per column

### 3.10 `latex_block`
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "latex_block",
  "order": 9,
  "latex": "\\frac{12 \\times m_2}{44 \\times m} \\times 100",
  "label": "Equation 12.1",
  "note": "Where m = mass of compound, m₂ = mass of CO₂"
}
```
- Use for display equations — important formulas that deserve their own line
- `latex` field: raw LaTeX without `$` delimiters
- JSON escaping: `\\frac`, `\\times` (double backslash in JSON = single `\` in LaTeX)

---

## 4. Standard Page Structure

### 4A. Class 11–12 (JEE / NEET) — Default Template

Every page should follow this flow. Adjust as needed but don't skip the hook or the exam tip.

```
Block 0:  callout[fun_fact]   ← Real-life hook. Opens curiosity.
Block 1:  text                ← Core concept: what it is, why it matters
Block 2:  heading[2]          ← Sub-section: first major part
Block 3:  text                ← Explanation with steps / mechanism
Block 4:  image               ← Diagram — ALWAYS include; src="" + generation_prompt if not yet uploaded
Block 5:  heading[2]          ← Sub-section: second major part (if exists)
Block 6:  text                ← Explanation
Block 7:  image               ← Second diagram if section warrants one
Block 8:  worked_example      ← NCERT solved example (if exists in source)
Block 9:  comparison_card     ← (optional) if two methods being compared
Block 10: callout[exam_tip]   ← JEE/NEET exam insight
Block 11: inline_quiz         ← 2–4 questions, always last
```

**Images are mandatory.** Every page must have at least one image block.  
- If no real image is available: use `src: ""` with a detailed `generation_prompt` — the renderer shows it as a copyable placeholder.
- Never omit images — they are part of the content structure.
- **If content is simple:** fewer blocks is fine, but the image block stays.
- **If no worked example exists in source:** skip it entirely.

---

### 4B. Class 9 — Reasoning-Embedded Template

Class 9 pages follow a different structure that embeds reasoning development into the content itself.
The goal is to build thinking skills alongside subject knowledge — never as a separate section.

```
Block 0:  reasoning_prompt    ← Opening reasoning challenge (ALWAYS FIRST on Class 9 pages)
Block 1:  callout[fun_fact]   ← Real-life hook
Block 2:  text                ← Core concept
Block 3:  heading[2]          ← Sub-section
Block 4:  text                ← Explanation
Block 5:  image               ← Diagram (mandatory; src="" + generation_prompt)
Block 6:  simulation          ← With prediction challenge (where a meaningful prediction exists)
Block 7:  text                ← Deeper explanation / what the sim reveals
Block 8:  worked_example      ← NCERT solved example (if exists)
Block 9:  callout[exam_tip]   ← Board exam insight (CBSE Class 9 — NOT JEE/NEET)
Block 10: inline_quiz         ← 3 questions: 1 recall + 1 application + 1 reasoning (always last)
```

#### reasoning_prompt block — Class 9 rules

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "reasoning_prompt",
  "order": 0,
  "reasoning_type": "logical",
  "prompt": "A student says: 'Heavier objects always fall faster than lighter ones.' What is wrong with this reasoning, and what experiment would prove it?",
  "options": ["The student is correct", "The student is wrong — mass doesn't affect fall speed in vacuum", "It depends on the shape of the object", "It depends on the material"],
  "reveal": "Galileo showed that in the absence of air resistance, all objects fall at the same rate regardless of mass. The student is confusing air resistance (which does depend on shape and size) with gravitational acceleration (which does not). This is a classic example of a conclusion being correct in some conditions but stated as a universal rule.",
  "difficulty_level": 2
}
```

**reasoning_type values and when to use:**
| Type | Use when | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `logical` | If-then relationships, cause and effect, identifying flawed reasoning | "If X, does Y always follow?" |
| `spatial` | Spatial relationships, diagrams, geometry, structures | "What shape will the shadow be?" |
| `quantitative` | Reasoning with numbers — NOT calculation, but estimation / plausibility | "Which is larger, and by roughly how much?" |
| `analogical` | Structural similarities between different domains | "How is this like a [different system]?" |

**difficulty_level guide for Class 9:**
- Level 1 (Comprehension): Recall a fact and state it. Minimum bar.
- Level 2 (Application): Apply a concept to a new but similar situation.
- Level 3 (Analysis): Break down a scenario, identify what is and isn't true.
- Level 4 (Evaluation): Evaluate a claim, identify the flaw, or construct a counter-argument.
- Level 5 (Pattern/Analogy): Identify a structural similarity across domains. Use sparingly.

Start with Level 2 on most pages. Level 3 when the concept naturally produces a testable prediction. Reserve Level 4–5 for chapters where the concept is well established and the student has had practice.

#### inline_quiz — Class 9 question mix

The final quiz on every Class 9 page must have exactly 3 questions in this order:
1. **Recall** (Level 1) — confirms the student read the page
2. **Application** (Level 2) — applies the concept to a new scenario
3. **Reasoning** (Level 3) — requires the student to think, not remember

Tag each question with `reasoning_level` for analytics:
```json
{ "id": "uuid", "question": "...", "options": [...], "correct_index": 0, "explanation": "...", "reasoning_level": 1 }
```

#### simulation prediction — when to use

Add `prediction` to a simulation block only when:
- There is a non-obvious outcome that the student can meaningfully predict
- The prediction has a concrete, observable answer in the simulation
- Getting it wrong teaches something (not just a trivial guess)

Do NOT add prediction to exploratory simulations (e.g., sliders that just visualise a formula).

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "type": "simulation",
  "order": 6,
  "simulation_id": "free-fall-gravity",
  "title": "Free Fall Simulator",
  "prediction": {
    "prompt": "A 1 kg ball and a 10 kg ball are dropped from the same height at the same time. Which lands first?",
    "options": ["The 10 kg ball lands first", "The 1 kg ball lands first", "Both land at exactly the same time"],
    "reveal_after": "Both balls land at the same time. Gravitational acceleration (g = 9.8 m/s²) is independent of mass — every object in free fall accelerates identically. The only reason a feather falls slower on Earth is air resistance, not gravity. On the Moon, with no atmosphere, a feather and a hammer fall together."
  }
}
```

---

## 5. Tone & Style Guide

### Voice
- **Second person:** "When you heat this mixture…", "You've probably seen…", "Think about…"
- **Conversational but accurate:** Explain like a smart tutor, not a textbook
- **Analogy first:** Always lead with a real-world analogy before the technical definition
- **No fluff:** Every sentence earns its place. Cut anything that doesn't add understanding.

### Bold text
- Bold key terms on **first use only**
- Bold important numbers or thresholds
- Bold "wrong" vs "right" distinctions in exam_tip callouts

### Lists
- Use **numbered lists** for processes that have a fixed order
- Use **bullet lists** for properties, conditions, or items without a fixed order
- Keep list items concise — one idea per bullet

### What NOT to do
- ❌ Don't start with "In this section, we will learn..."
- ❌ Don't copy NCERT prose verbatim — rephrase in simpler English
- ❌ Don't use passive voice ("It is observed that...") — use active ("You observe...")
- ❌ Don't add LaTeX for things that don't need it — `25°C` not `$25°C$`
- ❌ Don't add emoji to body text — only in image captions
- ❌ Don't fabricate NCERT content — if unsure, write NEEDS_REVIEW

---

## 6. LaTeX Rules (Book Page Context)

The renderer uses **KaTeX** with **mhchem** extension loaded. Both `$...$` (inline) and `$$...$$` (display/block) are supported. `\ce{}` works for chemical formulas.

### 6.1 Correct delimiters

| Use case | Correct | Wrong |
|---|---|---|
| Inline math in text | `$x = 5$` | bare `x = 5` |
| Display (centred) equation | `$$\frac{a}{b}$$` | do not use display for simple inline values |
| Chemical formula | `$\ce{H2SO4}$` | `H₂SO₄` (unicode) or `$H_2SO_4$` |
| Fraction | `$\frac{a}{b}$` | `$\dfrac{a}{b}$` — causes oversized render |
| Greek letters | `$\alpha$`, `$\Delta$` | `α`, `Δ` (unicode outside `$`) |
| Reaction arrow | `$\rightarrow$` | `→` (unicode outside `$`) |
| Equilibrium arrow | `$\rightleftharpoons$` | `⇌` |
| Superscript ion | `$\ce{Fe^{2+}}$` | `Fe²⁺` |
| Subscript in formula | `$\ce{CuSO4.5H2O}$` | `CuSO₄·5H₂O` |
| Reaction equation | `$\ce{A + B -> C + D}$` | raw text |

### 6.2 mhchem `\ce{}` syntax (use this for all chemistry)

```
$\ce{H2SO4}$           → H₂SO₄
$\ce{Fe^{2+}}$         → Fe²⁺
$\ce{CuSO4.5H2O}$      → CuSO₄·5H₂O
$\ce{Na + C + N -> NaCN}$    → reaction with arrow
$\ce{2Na + S ->[\Delta] Na2S}$  → with heat symbol above arrow
$\ce{CO2 + Ca(OH)2 -> CaCO3 v + H2O}$  → with precipitate arrow
$\ce{[Fe(CN)6]^{4-}}$  → complex ion
```

### 6.3 JSON string escaping

In JavaScript string literals (single or double quoted), one backslash = `\\`:
```js
// In JS string:  "$\\ce{H2O}$"   →  stored in DB as:  "$\ce{H2O}$"  ✓
// In JS string:  "$\\frac{a}{b}$"  →  stored in DB as:  "$\frac{a}{b}$"  ✓
```

**Rule:** Always use `\\` before every LaTeX command in JavaScript strings.
- `"$\\ce{H2SO4}$"` ✓
- `"$\\frac{12}{44}$"` ✓
- `"$\\Delta H$"` ✓
- `"$\\text{CO}_2$"` ✓

**Display equations in text blocks** — put `$$...$$` on its own line inside the markdown string:
```js
markdown: 'Formula:\n\n$$\\frac{12 \\times m_2}{44 \\times m} \\times 100$$\n\nwhere...'
```

### 6.4 DO NOT use unicode chemistry outside math
```
❌  "water is H₂O"          →  use "water is $\\ce{H2O}$"
❌  "ΔH = -286 kJ"          →  use "$\\Delta H = -286$ kJ"
❌  "Fe²⁺ ions"             →  use "$\\ce{Fe^{2+}}$ ions"
❌  "CO₂ is absorbed"       →  use "$\\ce{CO2}$ is absorbed"
```

### 6.5 What NOT to do
- ❌ `\dfrac` — oversized rendering, use `\frac`
- ❌ Using `\text{CO}_2` instead of `\ce{CO2}` — mhchem is available, always use `\ce{}`
- ❌ Nested `$` delimiters — every `$` must be paired
- ❌ Missing backslash-escape in JS strings — `"\ce{H2O}"` is wrong, `"\\ce{H2O}"` is right

## 7. Worked Examples — Extraction Rules

When the source PDF contains a "Problem X.XX" with a "Solution":

1. Extract problem statement verbatim (clean up OCR artefacts)
2. Format solution as markdown steps: `**Step 1:** ...`, `**Step 2:** ...`
3. Final answer on its own line: `**Answer:** value with units`
4. Use `label: "Problem 12.XX"` matching the NCERT numbering
5. Place the `worked_example` block immediately after the concept it illustrates

---

## 8. Qualitative Analysis Pages — Special Pattern

For Lassaigne's test and element detection pages, use this additional block types:
- `table` block for test summary (element → reagent → positive result)
- `callout[remember]` for the sodium fusion reactions

---

## 9. Quantitative Estimation Pages — Special Pattern

For pages covering carbon/hydrogen/nitrogen/halogen estimation:
- Lead with what is being measured and why
- Show the formula as a `latex_block` OR inside a `text` block
- `worked_example` block for each NCERT Problem in the section
- `comparison_card` to compare two methods (e.g. Dumas vs Kjeldahl)
- `exam_tip` must include: formula, what each symbol means, and typical exam calculation trap

## 11. Anti-Hallucination Rule

> Before writing any chemistry content, quote the exact NCERT source text (or confirm from PDF extraction) for every factual claim. If you cannot verify a fact from the source, write `NEEDS_REVIEW: [reason]`.
>
> Never invent reactions, test results, reagent names, or numerical values. All chemistry must come from the source PDF or verified NCERT Class 11 Chemistry content.
