So Te should have more negative EGE than Po (Te is above Po). The correct order is EGE(Te) > EGE(Po) in magnitude, meaning delta_eg_H(Te) < delta_eg_H(Po) is actually CORRECT. Wait - let me reconsider: going down Group 16: S > Se > Te > Po in EGE magnitude. So Te has less negative EGE than Se but more negative than Po. Statement (4) says delta_eg_H(Te) < delta_eg_H(Po), meaning Te is more negative than Po. This is CORRECT. Actually option (1) is the incorrect one: Cl(-349) has MORE negative EGE than F(-328), so delta_eg_H(Cl) < delta_eg_H(F) is CORRECT (Cl is more negative). The answer key says option (2) is incorrect: Se(-195) and S(-200), so S has more negative EGE. delta_eg_H(Se) < delta_eg_H(S) means Se is more negative than S - this is WRONG since S is more negative. So option (2) is the incorrect statement."},"metadata":{"difficulty":"Hard","chapter_id":"chapter_classification_of_elements","tags":[{"tag_id":"tag_periodic_3","weight":1.0}],"is_pyq":true,"is_top_pyq":false,"exam_source":{"exam":"JEE Main","year":2023,"month":"February","day":1,"shift":"Evening"}}},
