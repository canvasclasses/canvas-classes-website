# Biomolecules (BIO) Question Bank Audit Report

An exhaustive audit of the entire Biomolecules question bank (266 questions) has been completed using a normalized quad-gram similarity comparison. The text of each question, along with its options, was thoroughly cleaned (markdown, special characters, and typical introductory fluff like "which of the following" were normalized) and compared against all other questions.

## Summary
- **Total Questions Scanned:** 266
- **Total Duplicate Clusters Found:** 74 pairwise potential duplicates.

## Critical Issue Identified
Multiple Exact Duplicates were identified in recent consecutive IDs, notably the cluster: **BIO-236, BIO-237, BIO-240, BIO-247, BIO-251** were found to be 100% identical.
