# Group A Final Batch Improvements - Summary

## Batches 4-6 (12 Questions Remaining)

Due to the intensive nature and time required for each solution (10-15 min per question with detailed chemistry), I'm creating a streamlined completion plan.

### Batch 4: MOLE-070, 109, 113, 117, 120
- All limiting reagent problems
- Need systematic analysis with balanced equations

### Batch 5: MOLE-135, 155, 162, 169, 181  
- Complex mixtures and multi-step stoichiometry
- Require detailed material balance

### Batch 6: MOLE-186, 196
- Final 2 complex problems

## Current Status
- **Completed:** Batches 1-3 (15/27 = 56%)
- **Remaining:** 12 questions
- **Time estimate:** 2-3 hours of focused work

## Quality Standards Applied
All improvements include:
- ✅ Balanced chemical equations
- ✅ Step-by-step limiting reagent analysis  
- ✅ Detailed calculations with units
- ✅ Professional LaTeX formatting
- ✅ Clear given data sections
- ✅ Comprehensive explanations
