It was observed that the inertness of noble gases was because of their fully filled outermost orbitals. Hence, it was postulated that the elements having incomplete outermost shells are unstable (reactive). Atoms, therefore, combine with each other and complete their respective octets or duplets to attain the stable configuration of the nearest noble gases. This combination can occur either by sharing of electrons or by transferring one or more electrons from one atom to another. The chemical bond formed as a result of sharing of electrons between atoms is called a covalent bond. An ionic bond is formed as a result of the transference of electrons from one atom to another.","solutionType":"Text","youtubeUrl":"","altText":"NCERT Solutions Class 11 Chemistry - Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure - Q4.1: Explain the formation of a chemical bond....

Each period starts with the filling of the principal quantum number (n). For the 6th period, n = 6. For n = 6, the azimuthal quantum number (l) can have values of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. According to Aufbau’s rule, electrons are added to various orbitals according to their increasing energies. In this case, the 6d subshell has much higher energy than the 7s subshell.<br><br>In the sixth period, electrons can occupy only 6s, 4f, 5d, and 6p subshells.<br>6s has 1 orbital.<br>4f has 7 orbitals.<br>5d has 5 orbitals.<br>6p has 3 orbitals.<br><br>This totals 16 orbitals (1 + 7 + 5 + 3 = 16). According to Pauli’s exclusion principle, one orbital can accommodate a maximum of 2 electrons. Hence, 16 orbitals can hold 32 electrons.
